0.3.2
 - Added multiple defines for mlx keys.
 - Updated the README, won't be listing all functions anymore, and removed the wiki.
   After all this library is for my personal use and highly unlikely to be used by anyone else.
 - Added a define for continue in lol.h.
 - Renamed IMOUTTAYR to NOMOAR to avoid confusion.
